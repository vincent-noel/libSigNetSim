Welcome to libSigNetSim's documentation!
========================================

   libSigNetSim is a Python 2.7 library to create, simulate, adjust and analyse computer models of biological processes.
   It uses SBML format to read/write models, and can simulate them to produce timeseries or steady states curves.
   Simulations can be imported/exported using SEDML format.

   Complete modelling projects can be imported/exported using COMBINE archive format.
